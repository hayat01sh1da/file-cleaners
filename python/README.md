## 1. Environment

- Python 3.13.3

## 2. Execution

```command
$ cd ./python
$ python main.py
Provide the original extension of the files you would like to change(e.g., .jpg, .png, .rb, .py, .ts. .js etc.): .py
Provide the target extension of the files you would like to switch to by the change(e.g., .jpg, .png, .rb, .py, .ts. .js etc.): .rb
Provide -e(execution) if you would truly like to delete the files. This operation is cannot be undone, so trying to run without -e once is strongly recommended:
Target dirname is /mnt/c/Users/binlh/Documents/web/file-extensions-converter/python
