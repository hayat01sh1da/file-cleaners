## 1. Environment

- Ruby 3.4.3

## 2. Execution

```command
$ cd ./ruby
$ ruby main.rb 
Provide the directory which contains files you would like to delete
.   
Provide the dirname or filename pattern you would like to delete
*.rb
Provide -e(execution) if you would truly like to delete the files. This operation is cannot be undone, so trying to run without -e once is strongly recommended

Target dirname is /mnt/c/Users/binlh/Documents/web/file-cleaner/ruby
