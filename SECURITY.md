## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please
report it using one of the following private channels:

- **Preferred:** Open a private security advisory via the **“Security”** tab of
  this repository and select **“Report a vulnerability”**.
- **Alternative:** Email the maintainers at **security@project.org**.

Please include as much detail as possible in your report:

- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept code, test data, or configuration)
- The affected version(s) and environment (OS, runtime, browser, etc.)
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

### Our commitment

- We aim to **acknowledge** all vulnerability reports within **3 business days**.
- You can expect **status updates** at least every **7 business days** while we triage and remediate.
- Once a fix is available, we will publish a **security release** and, when appropriate,
  a **security advisory** describing the impact and remediation steps.

We strive for **coordinated disclosure** and, where possible, will work with you on
timelines before making details public. If we determine that a reported issue is
not a security vulnerability or is out of scope, we will explain our reasoning.
